# ft_printf
## _Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough_

On this project our focus is to recreate the printf function
You can have the subject on project repo.

**To compile the code you just need to**

`make`

**To use it in your code you have to include**

`#include "includes/ft_printf.h"`
