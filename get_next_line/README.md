# get_next_line

The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static variables.

Objectives:

- Calling the function in a loop will read the text available on a file descriptor, one line at a time until end of the file.
- Return 1 when a line has been read, 0 when EOF has been reached, -1 when an error happened.
